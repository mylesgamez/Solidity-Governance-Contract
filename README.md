# Solidity-Governance-Contract
A Solidity smart contract project for creating a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with governance features. This project allows the owner to create proposals, allows users to vote on proposals, and execute proposals based on the outcome of votes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you start using this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) or other Ethereum client for local development

### Usage
Create Proposal:
The owner can create a proposal by calling the createProposal function and providing a description for the proposal.

Vote on Proposal:
Users can vote on a proposal by calling the vote function and providing the proposal ID and a boolean indicating whether they are voting for or against the proposal.

Execute Proposal:
The owner can execute a proposal by calling the executeProposal function and providing the proposal ID. If the proposal has more votes for than against, it will be executed.

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Solidity-Governance-Contract.git
cd Solidity-Governance-Contract
```

### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Compile Contracts
Compile the Solidity smart contract with Truffle:
```
truffle compile
```

### Deploy Contracts Locally
Start your local Ethereum client, like Ganache, and deploy the contracts with Truffle:
```
truffle migrate --reset
```

### Test Contracts
Run the test suite using Truffle:
```
truffle test
